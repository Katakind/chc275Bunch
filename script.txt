It is a peaceful day in Luigiville
The sun is shining
The birds are chirping 
What could possibly go wrong?
???: Wahoo!
What's going on? It's 7 in the morning...
???: I'm a-Luigi, number one!
It's Luigi I hear, the mayor of Luigiville in the distance calling your name
You: What's going on Mayor Luigi?
Luigi: Let's A Go!
Luigi can't speak like a normal person 
He blurts out random voicelines like he's from a 2000's fighting game
This man
is somehow our mayor
...
You: What's wrong Luigi?
The more I look at him he looks worried.
Luigi: Oh No!
When I looked over he was pointing outside the house
You: Do you want me to come with you?
Luigi: Yeah Yeah!
As reluctant as I am to go outside after being SO abruptly woken up. I gave in
As soon as I look outside all I can think is-
You: Luigi. Why is it so dark out??? It was so bright from my house
Luigi just stared at me and said nothing                                                              
While walking down the street I noticed something odd...besides the fact its pitched black
You: Luigi. Where has everyone gone?
Luigi: Oh No!
Why do I ask him anything
After the first "Oh No" he went on to do it 30 MORE times
You: Hey Luigi can you describe to me what happened?
ONCE AGAIN why do I ask that??? He CANNOT speak
To save you from around 26 minutes of a living hell
Luigi dropped his wallet in the sewer
It took him 10 minutes to retrieve it
Why is this important???
He found a gateway to Hell
When he peeked in, from what I gathered, he saw his brother
then the sky became black
Why is this important?



To lengethen the plot


BUT 
Also due to the fact we can't have our Mayor in distress now can we?
...
can we?
You: Luigi do you need my help?
Luigi: Yeah Yeah!
I have a feeling that Luigi is holding info from me
Should I help him. Press space to help him. 
You: Yeah Luigi I can come.
Luigi: Lets A Go!
Luigi started walking off to the sewer at a moderately brisk pace
Not too surprising knowing his legacy
When we got there it was glowing all sorts of colors
Colors I didnt even know existed
You: Are you ready to go in?
Luigi: Lets A Go!
I jumped in the portal fearful of what could be on the other side.
When I made it out-
You: Why does this look like the most generic adaptation of Hell?
I look over and Luigi is there
I mean why wouldnt he be?
I actually need to stop talking to myself its taking up time and yknow its kinda annoyi-
Luigi: Mario!
Mario: Luigi!
As soon as they saw each other they would not stop yelling in exictement
You: Oh cool. Now that we have your brother do you want to leave? I don't like it here Luigi.
Luigi: Oh No.
What
Why does he want to stay here?
Luigi: Bye Bye!
As soon as Luigi said that he pulled out a hammer not just any hammer. 
A comically big hammer 
I couldn't find the wiki fast enough, but im sure it does something really cool
And do something cool it did
Luigi swung it at Mario and knocked him into a pillar
You: Luigi Why!
Luigi: Oh Yeah
Luigi: Im A Number 1!
Mario tried to retaliate, but since he got hit once 
He was already mini 
He swung at Luigi 
It didnt even faze the man
I don't even know if I can call him a man at this point
Luigi let out one more scream and sent mario flying
When he landed
He was as good as gone
Luigi: Luigi, Luigi, Oh Yeah! Oh Yeah! Luigi, Luigi, Oh Yeah! Oh Yeah!
I was in utter shock
I couldnt speak, move, or even think
After hearing Luigi repeat the same victory quote about 200 times
I asked
You: Why Luigi
Luigi stared straight at me
And to my disbelief
Luigi: A commoner like yourself could never understand the ideas of a free thinker like myself.
Huh
Huhhhhhh
HUUHHHHHHHH
Did Luigi just spe-
Luigi: Yes you heard me correctly. I CAN speak. I always could speak.
His voice was deep. There was no energy or exictement in his voice
He was as monotone as the average history teacher teaching about the downfall of Rome
Luigi: You went along to Hell with me. Why? No sane man would do that. Is it because I was your Mayor? Because I was your "friend"?
Luigi: Some person you are.
You: Why Luigi WHY. I HAD NO HOPE OF ANOTHER MARIO BASEBALL ALREADY. THIS SEALS THE DE-
Luigi: That is exactly the point. There will NEVER be another Mario Baseball.
Luigi: But
Luigi: Luigiz Super Sluggers is a possibility
You: You eliminated him to be in the spot light?
Luigi: ABSOLUTELY
Luigi: No sane man would stick with the same guy for 40 YEARS WITHOUT GOING INSANE
You: I can't wrap my head around it. I think.
You: I need a moment
Luigi: You will have all of eternity to have a moment.
Luigi: Death has nothing but moments of life.
Luigi: One is free to the thoughts and ideals of themselves.
Luigi: Would you care to join my dear dear brother?
I may not be the brighest, but I think this man. No
Satan himself wants to kill me
You: Not really, but hey what can I do?
Luigi had spite and hatred in his eye 
I shouldve known from the start
his lifeless eyes
fake expressions 
he never cared about Luigiville
It
was a front for power
while he was charging at me all I could think was
Memento Mori                                                                                         
What
What happened?
Where am I?
Did I die?
???: No my dear disciple 
???: You are everything but dead
That angelic voice
You: Mario 
Mario: Thank you for being a disciple of the MarioBaseballChurch
You: Anyday Mario! 
You: To what do I owe the pleasure
Mario: No dear disciple. The pleasure is mine!
Hearing such kind words after being betrayed by Luigi was rather calming.
Mario: I have two things for you to do
Mario: Go back to Hell and stop Luigi.
Mario: He has always been
Mario: Irrational?
Mario: Yeah that works
You: I can't do that Mario! I am way too weak for him!
Mario: You can with the divine inspiration of.



You: What?



Mario: Yeah I couldn't think of anything witty to say.
Mario: Just know you will be powered up.
You: Oh man well
You: That was underwhelming
Mario: They can't all be winner can they?
You: I guess not.
...
Silence
Nothing but silence 
after all thats been happening this is nic-
You: Oh yeah what else did you want?
Mario: Oh yeah!
Mario: Can you please unload images, and songs? Its causing the game to lag. 
You: Dude
You: I am on break, and it is 8:35 at night.
You: That is saved for part 2.
Mario: There is never going to be a part two.
Mario: And it is REALLY easy to 
Unl o a d 
i m   a    g    e    s 
I jumped off the clouds determined to stop Luigi!
You could say I was trying to leave the conversation
...
And you were right, but I am ready to stop him! 
I can do it!
You: Hey Luigi 
Luigi: I knew it was too good to be true
Luigi: People aren't ready for what I have in store
Luigi: A world full of hurt, hate, and pain is not worth living in. Wouldnt you agree?
Would I?
Would...
I???
You: No Luigi
You: That is not reality
You: If we cannot suffer
You: We cannot grow
You: Without growth we cant have true happiness
Luigi: But what is true happiness?
You: I dont know
Luigi: YOU DONT KNOW! 
Luigi: YOU HEAR THAT EVERYONE! HE DOESNT KNOW!
There is no one around us 
You: Sure I dont know
You: But I would like to 
You: An ideal reality isnt ideal to everyone is it?
You: Something like that isnt possible.
You: And that is why
You: We are done 
I launched myself at him with all my might
I couldnt tell what happened but something did
I landed on the ground 
When I did
My legs were severed from my body
All I could do
Was sleep
.
..
...
....
wake
up
I opened my eyes 
I was back to Luigiville, but
Its titled MarioBaseball Land!
And there are like 
7 baseball fields
Thats actually not a lot
WAIT MY LEGS-
are still there?
and in my shoe is a
Note?
"Dear mongrel (I assume that means me)
I assume you noticed you are still alive. Whilst I am not a fan of this I will have to accept it
You got lucky. Like REALLLLLLY lucky. No man has ever landed a blow on me before. The fact you did is quite concerning.
Accept the little time you have left and live. Live for what exactly? Thats for you to decide."-Mr.L 
Wow.
That WAS a letter.
Not a very good one 
I threw it near the trash completely missing-
and all I can think is
Nerf Monty Moonball Molerat. why is he meta? -9:13pm







I dare you hit it again. Trying to break my game huh????????
