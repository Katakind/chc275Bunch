It is a peaceful day in Luigiville
The sun is shining
The birds are chirping 
What could possibly go wrong?
???: Wahoo!
What's going on? It's 7 in the morning...
???: I'm a-Luigi, number one!
It's Luigi I hear, the mayor of Luigiville in a distance calling your name
You: What's going on Mayor Luigi?
Luigi: Let's A Go!
Luigi can't speak like a normal person 
He blurts out random voicelines like he's from a 2000's fighting game
This man
is somehow our mayor
...
You: What's wrong Luigi?
The more I look at him he looks worried.
Luigi: Oh No!
When I looked over he was pointing outside the house
You: Do you want me to come with you?
Luigi: Yeah Yeah!
As reluctant as I am to go outside after being SO abruptly woken up. I gave in
As soon as I look outside all I can think is-
You: Luigi. Why is it so dark out??? It was so bright from my house
Luigi just stared at me and said nothing                                                              #change luigi to staring straight
When
