It is a peaceful day in Luigiville
The sun is shining
The birds are chirping 
What could possibly go wrong?
???: Wahoo!
What's going on? It's 7 in the morning...
???: I'm a-Luigi, number one!
It's Luigi I hear, the mayor of Luigiville in the distance calling your name
You: What's going on Mayor Luigi?
Luigi: Let's A Go!
Luigi can't speak like a normal person 
He blurts out random voicelines like he's from a 2000's fighting game
This man
is somehow our mayor
...
You: What's wrong Luigi?
The more I look at him he looks worried.
Luigi: Oh No!
When I looked over he was pointing outside the house
You: Do you want me to come with you?
Luigi: Yeah Yeah!
As reluctant as I am to go outside after being SO abruptly woken up. I gave in
As soon as I look outside all I can think is-
You: Luigi. Why is it so dark out??? It was so bright from my house
Luigi just stared at me and said nothing                                                              #change luigi to staring straight
While walking down the street I noticed something odd...besides the fact its pitched black
You: Luigi. Where has everyone gone?
Luigi: Oh No!
Why do I ask him anything
After the first "Oh No" he went on to do it 30 MORE times
You: Hey Luigi can you describe to me what happened?
ONCE AGAIN why do I ask that??? He CANNOT speak
To save you from around 26 minutes of a living hell
Luigi dropped his wallet in the sewer
It took him 10 minutes to retrieve it
Why is this important???
He found a gateway to Hell
When he peaked in, from what I gathered, he saw his brother
then the sky became black
Why is this important?



To lengethen the plot


BUT 
Also due to the fact we can't have our Mayor in distress now can we?
...
can we?
You: Luigi do you need my help?
Luigi: Yeah Yeah!
I have a feeling that Luigi is holding info from me
Should I help him. Press Y to help him. Press N to decline
















































#If you said NO to Luigi
You: Sorry man. I got to go shopping. y'know how it is. like-uh what the heck was I going to say? Like 
I gotta eat or something y'know?
(I don't know what I was saying I was just saying stuff)
Luigi: It's Ok!
Hearing Luigi say something so kind is kinda surpri-
Then it happened
I felt a warm pain in my side
No wait
It feels kind of could
When I look down all I could see was blood
Luigi
Shot
Me 
In 
The 
Side
